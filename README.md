# Job-Invoice-Automation
Automatic Job Invoice Generation with all the information required.

I have a part time tutoring job where I had to track my working hours to create an invoice for the pay. I had to manually note down my working hours and create an invoice with all the details every month. So, I decided to automate the task. The project is implemented using Python and all the neccessary code is available here in this repository!

Basically I created events on my phone calendar and extracted data from the calendar using Google API. I utilized Python to exract and transform the calendar data as per my needs. I used the final information for the invoice creation. The invoice generation on liquid platform is automated using Selenium and other libraries.

Once, the invoice is generated, I can mail my Boss to pay me my salary :)
